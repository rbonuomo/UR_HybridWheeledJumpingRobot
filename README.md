# UR_HybridWheeledJumpingRobot
In this work, we apply a Model Predictive Controller to a wheeled robot with a prismatic extension joint, which can be considered a simple wheeled-legged system. We propose a scenario in which the robot should be controlled so to swing-up and balance, drive upright and finally jump over a gap. 

We also consider a PD controller so to make a comparision between the two control modalities for the balancing phase.
